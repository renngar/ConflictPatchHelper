* TODO Implement Structure Copying

This is for the Record Header and Ownership. Alternatively allow the user to
select which plugin the record should be copied from initially.

Simply commenting out the 'Record Header' and 'Ownership' check was not
sufficient. The current version doesn't throw any errors, but it did not work,
probably because they are structures.
