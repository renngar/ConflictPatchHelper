#+TITLE: Installation from GitHub

Copy ~Conflict Patch Helper.pas~ into your xEdit ~Edit Scripts~ directory. If
you do not have a current copy of ~mteFunctions.pas~, copy it too. You do not
need ~xEditAPI.pas~. It is shipped with xEdit and is included here only as a
convenience for myself while working on the script.
